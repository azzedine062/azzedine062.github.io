Provides detailed implementation guidance and best practices for each control to help organizations apply them effectively.

I've created a simple dashboard that maps security standards and frameworks to specific cloud configurations and resources across cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. This tool is designed to bridge the gap between traditional information security controls and modern cloud environments.

Why?

Cloud security compliance can feel overwhelming, especially when trying to align traditional standards with constantly evolving cloud services. This dashboard is especially helpful for:

Organizations without a CSPM or CNAPP solution

Auditors with limited cloud experience

CISOs and security leads

Cloud engineers or DevOps teams

It provides direct, actionable insights on what needs to be configured, monitored, or remediated.

How?

Maps each control from standards like ISO/IEC 27002:2022, ISO/IEC 27001:2015, ISO/IEC 27018:2019, and CSA Cloud Controls Matrix v4 to cloud-native resources, configurations, or services that need review.

Enables users to fill in compliance status, comments, and evidence per control â€” all in one place.

Can be used as a living compliance tracker, tailored for real-world cloud infrastructure.

Use Cases

Prepare for ISO/IEC 27001 audits with cloud-specific evidence

Perform cloud security compliance checks

Track compliance status and fill in auditor-ready comments per control

Ensure alignment with cloud best practices and documentation


Open Source

This project is open source and built to help the security and cloud community bridge the gap between standards and real-world cloud implementations.

Feel free to use, adapt, or improve it for your own organization, audits, or learning.

Parts of this project were created with the help of AI tools (e.g., Claude.ai, ChatGPT).
