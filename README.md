# ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Cloud Controls Mapping

Provides detailed implementation guidance and best practices for each control to help organizations apply them effectively

![ISO/IEC 27002:2022 Cloud Controls Mapping](https://github.com/azzedine062/ISO-CloudControlMap/blob/76243a4217cf29c2e33b2c189bcec512e8592d25/ISO%20Cloud%20Controls%20Mapping%201.png)

I've created a simple dashboard that maps ISO/IEC 27002:2022 controls to specific cloud configurations and resources across cloud platforms like AWS, Azure. This tool is designed to bridge the gap between traditional information security controls and modern cloud environments.

Why?:

Cloud security compliance can feel overwhelming especially when trying to align traditional ISO/IEC 27002:2022 controls with constantly evolving cloud services.

This dashboard is especially helpful for:

    Organizations without a CSPM or CNAPP solution

    Auditors with limited cloud experience

    CISOs and security leads

    Cloud engineers or DevOps teams 

It gives them direct, actionable insights on what needs to be configured, monitored, or remediated.

 How ? :

    Maps each ISO/IEC 27002:2022 control to specific cloud-native resources, configurations, or services that need to be reviewed.

    Enables users to fill in compliance status, comments, and evidence per control â€” all in one place.

    Can be used as a living compliance tracker, tailored for real-world cloud infrastructure.

Use Cases:

    Prepare for ISO/IEC 27001 audits with cloud-specific evidence

    Perform cloud security compliance checks

    Track compliance status and fill in auditor-ready comments per control

    Ensure alignment with cloud best practices and documentation


This project is open source and built to help the security and cloud community bridge the gap between ISO/IEC 27002:2022 controls and real-world cloud implementations.

Feel free to use, adapt, or improve it for your own organization, audits, or learning.
